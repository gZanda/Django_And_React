## 📌 Reminders

✅​ - React works with COMPONENTS --> Blocks of functions that return HTML , building the application logic

✅​ - "App.js" is the supreme component, it index all the other components

✅​ - Single Page --> Use conditional render to display just what you need

✅​ - Multi Page --> Use REACT ROUTER to render multiple different components like if it was multiple pages ( Routering )

✅​ - Event Handling --> Functions to deal with user actions

✅​ - React Hooks --> Ways to control and mopdify functional components in REACT

✅​ - `useState` hook --> Similiar to a variable, make dinamic content

✅​ - `useEffect` hook --> Side effect, a function that is trigged automatically

✅​ - `useNavigate` hook --> Navigation / Redirect in without page refresh ( needs a `<route>` )
