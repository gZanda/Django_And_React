## ðŸ“Œ Reminders

âœ…â€‹ - React works with COMPONENTS --> Blocks of functions that return HTML , building the application logic

âœ…â€‹ - "App.js" is the supreme component, it index all the other components

âœ…â€‹ - Single Page --> Use conditional render to display just what you need

âœ…â€‹ - Routering --> Use REACT ROUTER to render multiple different components like if it was multiple pages

âœ…â€‹ - Event Handling --> Functions to deal with user actions ( HTML events, like "onClick" )

âœ…â€‹ - React Hooks --> Ways to control and modify functional components in REACT

âœ…â€‹ - `useState` hook --> Similiar to a variable, make dinamic content

âœ…â€‹ - `useEffect` hook --> Side effect, a function that is trigged automatically

âœ…â€‹ - `useNavigate` hook --> Navigation / Redirect in without page refresh ( needs a `<route>` )
