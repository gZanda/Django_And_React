## ðŸ“Œ Reminders

âœ…â€‹ - Always add new DEPENDENCIES and APPS to the "settings.py"

âœ…â€‹ - Before making and endpoint in the view: Make the MODEL SERIALIZER to convert JSON's

âœ… - What is a Serializer ? It's a class to convert OBJECTS/JSON

âœ…â€‹ - Sinalize endpoints with DECORATORS ( @ )

âœ…â€‹â€‹â€‹ - Be carefull with URL names and derivates

âœ… - MODEL it's just the "template" of the database ( ORM )

âœ… - VIEW it's the request handler ( gonna modify the model )
